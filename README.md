- **Assignment:** Setup **Virtual Box**, Ubuntu server, Docker desktop, Setup **localstack** (Cloud Emulator).
- **VM SSH** - `ssh -i hammedkey Hammed@172.190.74.173`
- **hammedkey.pub**
``` ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIGgI/1DZ4/LLx52MgqhV99u91p1tIEBU2k9b60wkyPMK hammed@Hammed```

## DAY 5 - Infrastructure as Code IaC
- Terraform
- Pulumi
- Cloud Formation

In Terraform, we use command like "**terraform plan**" to connect to the cloud platform (e.g. AWS), check resource availability, check the stage, "**terraform apply**" to create resource, "**terraform destroy**" to delete your infra.

**Terraform state and state file** - tfstate - To store infra state files. It is preferably in an object form, for example AWS S3 bucket. We can **lock** the statefile from multiple updates by keeping keys in the Dynamo DB or the new method to add lock keys to terraform itself.
